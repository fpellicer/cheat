# To generate an SSH key:
ssh-keygen -t rsa

# To generate a 4096-bit SSH key:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

# To update a passphrase on a key
ssh-keygen -p -P old_passphrase -N new_passphrase -f /path/to/keyfile

# To remove a passphrase on a key
ssh-keygen -p -P old_passphrase -N '' -f /path/to/keyfile

# To generate a 4096 bit RSA key with a passphase and comment containing the user and hostname
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "$USER@$HOSTNAME" -P passphrase

# Show fingerprint from ssh_host_key.pub
ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/ssh_host_key.pub

# Search host in known_hosts
ssh-keygen -F <ip/host> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

# Show fingerprints from known_hosts
ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts

# Remove host from known_hosts
ssh-keygen -R <ip/host> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

# To prevent new hashed entries
# In /etc/ssh/ssh_config comment the line 'HashKnownHosts yes'
